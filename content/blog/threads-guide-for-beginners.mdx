## What Is Threads?

Threads is a social sharing platform that allows discussion and the sharing of ideas through text messages and operates similarly to X (formerly Twitter).

Threads aims to offer a friendly environment for users to interact with one another.

Finding friends and other individuals to follow is a process much like any other social media app, except that potential members of Threads need an Instagram account in order to sign up for Threads.

Threads was created by a team at Instagram for the purpose of replicating the positive sharing experiences on Instagram and translating that over to a new, text-based platform.

What Instagram and Threads share is a focus on creators (people who create content) and connecting people in a positive manner.

The Instagram [announcement of Threads](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/threads-instagram-text-feature) explained:

<Callout>
“Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and expand that to text, creating a positive and creative space to express your ideas.

Hopefully we will.”

“Just like on Instagram, with Threads, you can follow and connect with friends and creators who share your interests – including the people you follow on Instagram and beyond.

And you can use our existing suite of safety and user controls.”

## How Does Threads Work?

Threads is what’s known as a micro-blogging platform, which means it’s essentially used as a blog that’s limited to shorter posts. Even a short blog post typically consists of a few hundred words, but a tweet consists of a maximum of 280 characters. In a lot of cases, tweets consist of fewer than 50 words.

When a user publishes a tweet to the world, other Threads users can interact with that tweet in various ways. Users can click the heart-shaped button to “like” a tweet, or they can click the button that’s made of arrows going in a circular pattern to “re-post” a tweet and share it with their followers. Users also have the option of using a “quote tweet” where they can re-post a tweet and add their own text.

Like most social media platforms, Threads allows users to comment on public posts as well. Keeping in touch with your customers through Threads replies can be a great way to build and manage customer relationships especially if you’re targeting a demographic that uses Threads.

The difference between Instagram and Threads is that Threads enables members to exchange ideas and share events through discussions. Instagram is about sharing experiences through images and videos.

Threads is a text-based social sharing app where members can share comments about themselves, discuss current events and news, and engage in dialogue.

Instagram enables users to follow others and share images and videos but is not as well optimized for engaging in real-time discussions.

The Threads app was developed by the Instagram team because, initially, it was going to be a part of Instagram.

That changed toward the end of 2022 when it became apparent that, with the decline of Twitter (now X), the time was ideal for launching a competitor.

## How to Use Threads: A Guide for Beginners

If you’re new to Threads, you might be looking for a Threads guide for beginners. The good news is that starting a Threads account for your business is easy, especially if you’re willing to spend some time curating your content and building a following. In this section, we’ll talk about how to create a Threads account and build a solid following.

### 1\. Create a Threads account

To get started on Threads, the first thing you need to do is create your Threads account. Creating a Threads account is as simple as providing a bit of basic information and choosing a name for your Threads account. In addition to your display name, you’ll need to choose a unique name that’s known as your handle. This handle is how other users will find your company’s Threads account.

When it comes to your Threads handle, you want to choose something simple that’s easy to remember. Try to avoid using too many special characters and numbers in your name so that you can make it easier to read and write.

### 2\. Upload a profile picture

Your profile picture is one of the first things people see on your Threads, so choose a profile picture that represents your brand. This could be a picture of your storefront, or it could be a brand logo or something similar. You don’t have to spend too much time finding a good profile picture, but you should at least find something that fits your brand.

### 3\. Write your bio

When people visit your Threads profile, your bio is one of the first things they’re going to see. This bio should contain some basic information about your brand, including anything important you want people to know when they first visit your profile. You can also include any hashtags related to your brand, as well as your location in the “Location” section of your profile.

### 4\. Link to your website

If you want your tweets to help grow your website, you need to make sure your Threads profile has a link to your website. If one of your posts gets a lot of impressions and people start visiting your profile, you want them to see a link to your website as quickly as possible. You can do this by adding a link under the “Links” section. If you want to add multiple links to your bio, you can also include links in the written portion of your bio.

### 5\. Follow other users

Threads isn’t much good if you’re not interacting with people, so take some time to follow other users who may be in a similar industry as you. Threads can help you find people to follow based on your interests, or you can start by searching for the names of some of the people and brands you want to follow. Following and interacting with other users is a great way to increase visibility and help boost your brand.

### 6\. Share content

The last thing you need to do to take advantage of Threads is share content. Your content can be anything you want it to be, but the main goal should be getting people to read, reply, and share. The more people start to look at your content and share it on their own timelines, the more that content will start to spread and reach a larger audience.

Good examples of shareable content include informative blog posts, videos about your products or services, links to sales and deals, infographics, and funny content. As is the case when you [build a website](/features/website-builder/), the content you choose depends on your brand and the tone you want it to have.

## Threads Terminology Explained

When you’re just getting started, Threads can be a little confusing with all the terminology people use. From tweets to mentions and handles, there are a lot of simple words that take on different meanings when it comes to Threads. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most popular Threads terminology.

### Handle

A Threads handle is the unique name that people use to find your Threads profile. When people say their Threads handle, they typically say “at” before their handle; this is written as “@`[your handle]`”. Your Threads handle is also used in the URL for your profile page, where you can find it after the “/” at the end of the Threads URL.

When you start an account, take some time to find a good handle that’s not too complex. You want a Threads handle that’s easy to type and read, so try to avoid overusing numbers or special characters.

### Hashtag

Hashtags are one of the most important aspects of Threads, especially if you’re a brand trying to reach a larger audience. Each hashtag starts with “#” followed by a single word or combination of words. When a Threads user clicks a hashtag, they can look at all the recent Tweets that have used that hashtag. Using hashtags in tweets can help you reach a larger audience, including people who don’t follow you.

### Like

When someone sees a post they like, they can express that by clicking the “Like” button. The “Like” button is a small, heart-shaped button that’s found beneath every tweet. When a person likes a tweet, the number of likes is displayed next to the heart. People can look at what others have liked on Threads, and those liked posts will even show up on the timelines of users who don’t follow you from time to time.

### Mention

When a person types “@” followed by your Threads handle, you get a notification when the tweet is sent; this is known as mentioning someone. It’s common for big brands to mention celebrities in their posts, whether they’re working on an ad campaign together or simply trying to engage with another profile.

Keep in mind that mentions can be annoying if you overuse them. For the best results, you should try to use mentions somewhat sparingly.

### Quote tweet

A quote tweet is like a quote from the old days of forums. When you quote a tweet, you’re sharing the original tweet and adding your own thoughts to it. You might use a quote tweet to voice an opinion or respond to your customers in public. When you quote a tweet, it’s shown on your timeline as one of your tweets.

Quote tweets can be a great way to interact with your customers and jump into conversations to help grow your Threads presence. Simply quoting a tweet and sharing your opinion on a topic can give your brand a big boost.

### Re-post

If you simply want to share a tweet without adding any of your own thoughts, you can re-post it. The re-post button is the same as the quote tweet button; you’ll be given the option between re-posting and quote tweeting once you click the button. If you choose to re-post a tweet, this button should turn green and you should be good to go.

While re-posts can be a good way to share valuable content with your followers, try to avoid spamming your timeline with re-posts.

### Thread

A Threads thread is a group of several related tweets. People use threads to have a slightly longer conversation about a topic, with some threads including more than a dozen tweets. If you have strong feelings about something or you want to share some valuable information with customers, threads can help you provide a little more detail.

## Tips for Using Threads

Getting started with Threads is simple enough, but using it properly can be tough. Here are some tips for using Threads by Instagram for your business.

### Define branding guidelines

Start by establishing clear branding guidelines that you can use as a guide for your tweets and Threads presence. You can use tools to manage digital assets to make it easier to keep your branding consistent, but deciding on clear branding guidelines is an important first step.

You should try to find a post format you can reuse, which may include the fonts and colors you use in images you share, your tone of voice, and more. As a brand, you need to be aware of how your tweets reflect on your company.

If you’re not sure what sort of look, feel, or presence your brand should have on Threads, you can always look at your website for inspiration.

### Engage with your audience

Engaging with your audience is the most important part of using Threads the right way. This starts with creating interesting content that gets people to look at and share your tweets, but that’s not all you have to do. When somebody quotes one of your tweets with a question or gives you constructive criticism on one of your tweets, you should take the time to respond to them. Responding to your customers (and potential customers) can help you build trustworthiness and establish brand authority.

You can also engage with your audience by liking and re-posting tweets that your customers share, especially tweets that mention your brand. The more you can do to keep your audience engaged and ready to read your posts, the better off your brand will be.

### Track performance

Social media marketing doesn’t do you a whole lot of good if you can’t measure its performance. Our final tip for using Threads for your business is to track the performance of your tweets regularly to see how you’re doing. Are your tweets getting a lot of impressions? If so, are people who view your tweet liking or sharing it?

Of course, tracking your performance is only part of the battle. If you notice certain types of tweets don’t perform particularly well, consider switching those tweets up a bit or eliminating them altogether. Taking action based on performance data is an essential part of successful social media marketing.

## Final Notes

Threads is a great social media marketing tool if you use it right, but there’s a bit of a learning curve. As a business owner, it’s important that you take the time to figure out the basics of social media and how to use social media to boost brand awareness and marketing efforts.
