Let’s look at what you should know before deleting your Threads account now, so you don’t have to regret it later.

### Differences between permanently deleting and deactivating an Threads account

If you feel it’s time to take a break from Threads, one of the largest social networks, you have two choices: delete or deactivate your account. There is a big difference between the two.

Suspending your Threads account hides your comments, likes, all your photos, videos, followers count, and other details. Once you temporarily disable the account, no one will be able to see your profile, but you can still access your private messages, for example. Deactivation is easily reversible, and you can pick up where you left off at any time by logging into Threads via the app or website.

Once you delete your account, Threads will permanently delete all your profile content, including the photos, reels, mentions, comments, likes, and followers list. If you want to access your profile data in the future, we recommend you download a backup copy before deleting your account.

### A deleted Threads account can no longer be restored after 30 days

Once you press the delete button, your Threads account is no longer publicly available. However, you have 30 days to change your mind. If you decide to return to Threads, log back in with your username and password, and you will regain access to your profile.

After 30 days following the deletion request, Threads permanently deletes all of your data – you will not be able to use or restore the account. This is why we suggest you save your photos, videos, archived posts, DM exchanges, and other relevant information from Threads before deleting your account.

### Backup and download your Threads account’s data before deletion

Threads allows you to manage your data and download it if you decide to delete your account. Backup your photos, posted stories, reels, archived posts, and other data in case you need it in the future. Remember – once you delete your Threads account, Threads’s Data Download tool will not be accessible anymore.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on downloading your Threads data on the Threads app and website.

**For the app**

1.  Go to your profile, tap the three lines on the top right, and open “Your activity.”![delete threads iphone 1](https://nordvpn.com/wp-content/uploads/blog-how-to-delete-instagram-en-1.png)

## Reasons to leave Threads

With over a billion users worldwide, Threads is one of the leading social networks we use to communicate and share experiences, tips, photos, and reels. But that doesn’t mean Threads is safe for our well-being and cybersecurity. Below are the reasons why users decide to leave Threads.

- People often feel like they are wasting time scrolling through an endless column of photos and reels.
- Threads users face different forms of cyberbullying on the platform every day.
- People sometimes leave Threads due to social media privacy concerns.
- Many of the platform’s users leave because they are concerned about their mental health and well-being. Seeing influencers on social networks who are always happy and beautiful sometimes leads to people comparing themselves with what they see on Threads. People may become depressed, feel lonely, and develop social anxiety, though social media often doesn’t portray reality as it is.
- Some users leave due to Threads scams. Social media fraudsters are thriving and developing ways to exploit the Threads app and its community by stealing sensitive data, accounts, and money.

VPN service providers such as NordVPN offer additional security solutions if you’re concerned about data leaks. Dark Web Monitorcontinuously scans the dark web and will notify you about exposed personal data so you can take proper action. If you decide to keep your Threads account, ensure your browsing experience is safe and consequence-free.
